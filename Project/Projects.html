              <p class="P1Python">
                During an internship, I was tasked with building an automation
                solution to support internal testing workflows. I developed a
                Python script that processed JSON payloads, validated their
                data, and compared them against a database to identify matches.
                When matches were found, the algorithm appended them to the JSON
                payload for further use. The backend was written in Python,
                while the frontend was implemented in Oracle APEX. This project
                successfully reduced manual effort and improved testing
                efficiency.

                I cannot show the actual production application due to
                confidentiality agreements, but the user interface was a typical
                form-driven web app that collected input, processed it through
                the backend algorithm, and returned results. Below is a
                placeholder example image of an Oracle APEX application.

                To demonstrate the type of data my code worked with, here is a
                generic example of a JSON payload:

                I worked on a full-stack web project involving C#, TypeScript,
                Angular, and SQL. The goal was to create an internal tool that
                allowed team members to log and track changes across different
                sections of a large management system. This tool was designed to
                improve efficiency by making it easier to search, create, and
                edit change records across the system.

                Due to confidentiality agreements, I cannot disclose the exact
                implementation, but the tool displayed data from a database,
                allowed edits, and ensured changes were reflected immediately
                after saving.

                On the frontend, I implemented responsive features using SCSS,
                TypeScript, and Angular.

              <p class="P3GraphingCalculator">
                This project is a browser based graphing calculator in an
                attempt to replicate the abilities of the online graphic
                calculator Desmos. This project was done with JavaScript, HTML,
                and CSS using Math.js to parse and evualate equations. It has a
                side bar where the user can add and remove functions themselves.
                Each function has 1 of 4 distinct colors. The main graph is on
                an HTML5 canvas, which draws axes, grid lines, and the functions
                in real time. The user can zoom in and out, drag the graph,
                hover to see the exact coordinates on the graph, and it can
                calculate the area underneath the curve using the trapezoidal
                rule.
