              <h2>Python Algorithm</h2>
              <p class="P1Python">
                This project was done at my internship at Cambria. I was tasked
                with automating a test the factory wanted. This was a big
                project the factory wanted completed to help speed up their
                testing process. I wrote a python script that would take a JSON
                payload that had already been created, take that payload, parse
                it, gathered all of the data that was sent, verified that the
                data was applicable to the test. If applicable I would then run
                a comparison against a database to see if I could find a match,
                if a match was found the algorithm would add it to the JSON
                payload. The users would then take this data and decide what to
                do with it. The backend was written in Python, my side, and the
                front facing side was written in APEX Oracle. The project was a
                success and the factory was able to speed up their testing
                process by a significant amount. For some representation of the
                project I have some included photos of what the project would
                look like.

              <p>
                I would like to be able to include a picture of how the frontend
                application would look, but for me to replicate the information
                that would be needed to show the front end would take too long,
                as I am not a APEX Oracle developer, nevertheless, here is a
                blank photo of an application in APEX Oracle. We can say instead
                that the front facing end was a similar view as the website
                currently, where the user was allowed to submit their data into
                the website, that data would be sent back in a JSON payload to
                the algorithm and from their my algorithm would finish the work.
                It may look blank, but I signed an NDA so I can't show the real
                thing. Just use your imagination and picture user input boxes
                and a returning output.
